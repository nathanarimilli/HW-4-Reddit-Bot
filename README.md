**1.Clearly states which politician your bot is supporting or opposing.**

My bot isn't directly supporting a specific politician. However, my bot is commenting a ton of random opinions, negative and positive, about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Donald Trump on reddit.

**2.Provides a link to your favorite thread involving your bot, an image screenshot of the thread, and a short description of what you like about it.**
