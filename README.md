# HW-4-Reddit-Bot

**1. Clearly states which politician your bot is supporting or opposing.**

My bot isn't directly supporting a specific politician. However, my bot is commenting a ton of random opinions, negative and positive, about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz on reddit.

**2. Provides a link to your favorite thread involving your bot, an image screenshot of the thread, and a short description of what you like about it.**

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/comment/hmbugg3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is the link to my favorite thread involving my bot. This is my favorite thread just because I thought these comments were so random but funny at the same time because they are insulting political figures in a pretty realistic and passionate way.

**3. Includes the output of running the bot_counter.py file on your bot to count how many comments you've created. The output of this command must be inside of a markdown code block (i.e. use the triple backticks notation).**

Here is my bot_counter.py output

    len(comments)= 1000
    len(top_level_comments)= 801
    len(replies)= 199
    len(valid_top_level_comments)= 364
    len(not_self_replies)= 199
    len(valid_replies)= 146
    ========================================
    valid_comments= 510
    ======================================== 

Also, here is my screenshot from the python terminal after running my bot_counter.py file.

**4. Explains what you believe your score should be. Clearly state which tasks you complete/don't complete.**

My score should be 24/30 based on the rubric. 

By completing all 6 bot.py tasks successfully and creating this github repo, I should be at 20 points at least.

I was also able to get 100 valid comments posted and 500 valid comments posted so this should be 4 points.

I attempted to complete the other extra credit tasks but wasn't very successful.

**Total: 24/30**
